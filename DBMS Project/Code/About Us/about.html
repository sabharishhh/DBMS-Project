            Founded in 1960, Med Care Hospital began as a small clinic with just
            10 beds and one dedicated doctor. It was established with a vision
            by Dr. John Mathew, a pioneer in medical service, who aimed to
            create a healthcare institution that provided quality medical care
            with a human touch. What started as a modest venture has now
            blossomed into a world-class, multi-specialty hospital known for its
            excellence in patient care.

            going the extra mile to ensure comfort, we treat each patient with
            the same level of care and dignity as we would our own family. By
            creating an environment of trust and respect, we ensure that
